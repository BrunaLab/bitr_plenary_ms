## 1. Collection, processing, and visualization of bibliometric data 

\noindent To identify the conceptual domains studied by researchers working in 'Tropical' and "non-Tropical' locations, I used information extracted from the bibliographic records of articles published from `r (as.numeric(start_yr))`-`r (as.numeric(end_yr))` in N = `r n_jrnls` journals (_`r titles_string`_). Specifically, I analyzed two complementary structural elements with which authors describe the content of their articles -- the title and keywords. Below I describe how the article records were identified, downloaded, processed, and assigned to the 'Tropical' and "non-Tropical' categories using code written in the `R` programming language [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023].  
    On 8 February 2023, I downloaded all bibliographic data available in SCOPUS and the Web of Science 'Core Collection' for all articles published in the focal journals; both SCOPUS and the Web of Science were queried because they differ in the years indexed for each journal. I then used the `refsplitr` package [@fournierRefsplitrAuthorName2020] to process the records and remove any duplicates. After removing all stopwords [@benoitStopwordsMultilingualStopword2021] from article titles and keywords, I spell-checked, stemmed, and lemmatized all of the keywords and title words and extracted the bigrams (i.e., pairs of sequential words, e.g., _seed predation_, _species diversity_) from titles with the `tidytext` library [@silgeTidytextTextMining2016]. Finally, I identified each article as either 'Tropical' or 'non-Tropical'; all articles published in (_`r titles_string`_) were assigned to the 'Tropical' category, while articles published in the other journals were assigned to one of these categories based on a search of the titles, keywords, or abstracts for a list of domain-specific terms (e.g., tropical: _amazon_, _andes_, _congo_, _bci_, _chamela_; non-tropical: _finland_, _boreal_, _eastern decid_, _arctic_, _polar_). These procedures resulted in N = `r scales::comma(as.numeric(n_pubs))` total articles published, of which N = `r scales::comma(as.numeric(n_pubs_trop))` reported research conducted in the tropics and N = `r scales::comma(as.numeric(n_pubs_gen))` were based on work conducted in other locations. Collectively, these articles used N = `r scales::comma(as.numeric(n_kw))` and N = `r scales::comma(as.numeric(bigrams_count))` title bigrams.  
    The number of articles varies widely between journals, as does the number of keywords per article. Comparing counts of keyword frequency in tropical and non-tropical articles could therefore bias results towards the content published a small number of journals. To correct for this, I calculated the percentage of articles in each geographic category that using each keyword or title bigram. I then selected the N = `r cutoff` most frequently used terms in each geographic category, and identified (a) any terms that 'tropical' and 'non-tropical' articles had in common, and (b) any terms that were unique to each article category.  

## 2. Data and Code

\noindent The data used in this publication are available at Dryad <_DOI added upon acceptance_>. The code used to import, organize, and analyze these data, along with the code for preparing the figures, tables, and manuscript, are available at Zenodo <_DOI added upon acceptance_>.  
  The data used in this paper are part of a larger data set collected for a longitudinal study of research in the tropics. That data set and the code used to harvest, clean, and organize it are available at Github <https://github.com/BrunaLab/tropical_bibliometrics>. Questions regarding the data or code, or suggestions for improvement should be posted as Issues on that repository or referred to E. M. Bruna.
